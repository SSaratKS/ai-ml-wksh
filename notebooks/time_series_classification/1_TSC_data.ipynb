    "# 1 Time series classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series classification (TSC) operates on time series data, a series of values that is ordered by time. Data samples are labelled as belonging to a particular class. The TSC system is trained using this data to classify unlabelled samples. There is a wide range of TSC applications. Smartwatch data is used to classify human activities (walking, running, ascending stairs, etc.). Animal behaviour (hunting, sleeping) is monitored using accelerometers on tagged, wild animals for environmental studies. Sensors on industrial machines are used to classify time series samples as either normal or preceding a failure, informing machine maintenance schedules."

    "This workshop uses the SonyAIBORobotSurface1 dataset from the [Time Series Classification Repository](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com) (Dau et al, 2018). This dataset was collected by Vail and Veloso (2004), Carnegie Mellon University, from an accelerometer on a Sony AIBO robot. Their aim was to detect the surface that the robot was walking on in order to optimise its gait for that surface. The robots competed in the RoboCup League, a football game played on a carpeted field.\n",
