#Image Classification Workshop Outline

## Alistair's talk on an introduction to the neural network.

## Dataset
Download, analyse, and view data

### Excercise 1
Load similar looking data points (e.g. coat, jumper) and discuss its similarity and differences
## Neural Network Model
Build, train, and test a neural network model on the dataset.
### Excercise 1 (Model Tuning)
Tune the model, change the batch size, hidden neurons, hidden layers, and epochs and observe its effects on 
speed and accuracy.
### Excercise 2 (Analysis)
Check how the model performed on the various image, especially where it failed.

## Use MNIST dataset
Group activity where each group executes the pre-provided notebook for MNIST dataset. Each group will compete to obtain the highest accuracy.
